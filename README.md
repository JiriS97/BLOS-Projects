# BLOS Projects
This repository is a collection of programs written by me on BLOS lessons on BUT (VUT Brno in Czech).
These programs are written in VHDL/Schematic, task description is included in each project folder when possible.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
To compile these projects yourself you will need Xilinx ISE 14.3 or newer with license (at least trial license).
All projects are developed for [Nexys3 development board from Digilent Inc.](http://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-3-spartan-6-fpga-trainer-board-limited-time-see-nexys4-ddr/) with Spartan6 FPGA.
Schematic of this board, reference manual and pin map (ucf file) are included in this repository.
